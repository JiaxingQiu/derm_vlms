1833,benign,"The image shows a round, brown lesion with a relatively uniform color. It is surrounded by skin with hair follicles and hairs. The lesion appears to be slightly raised and has a smooth, non-irregular border.",benign,"The lesion is a well-defined, round, brown macule with a relatively uniform color. It appears to be a benign melanocytic lesion, possibly a nevus."
1191,benign,"The image shows a skin lesion with a central, dark brown, irregularly shaped area surrounded by lighter, tan-colored skin. There are also five purple areas, likely marking the location of a biopsy or other procedure. The surrounding skin has a fine, reticular pattern and some visible hair follicles. The lesion appears to be relatively small, with an irregular border.",benign,"The image shows a skin lesion with a central brown pigmented area surrounded by a lighter, tan-colored area. There are also several purple marks, which appear to be ink markings made by a dermatoscope. The central brown area is irregular in shape and has a somewhat heterogeneous pigmentation. The surrounding tan area is also irregular and has a somewhat reticular appearance. The overall appearance of the central brown area is concerning for a melanocytic lesion, but further evaluation is needed to determine if it is benign or malignant."
610,benign,"The image shows a skin lesion with a pinkish-red background. There are several white, scaly patches of varying sizes and shapes within the lesion. Some of these patches appear to be peeling or flaking. There are also several dark hairs visible within the field of view. The lesion appears to be surrounded by normal skin. The scale bar indicates that the lesion is approximately 1 mm in size.",Benign,"The image shows a skin lesion with a light pinkish-tan color. It has a somewhat irregular shape and a slightly raised, textured surface. There are also several small, white, scaly areas within the lesion. The lesion appears to be surrounded by hair follicles and hairs. The lesion is small, and it is difficult to determine its exact size without a scale. The lesion does not appear to have any features that would suggest it is malignant. It is likely a benign lesion, such as a seborrheic keratosis or a similar benign skin growth."
1053,benign,"The lesion is a small, brown, starburst-like structure with irregular borders. It appears to be located within a slightly raised, pale pink area of skin. There are several hairs visible in the surrounding skin. A ruler is visible in the bottom left corner.",benign,"The lesion is a small, brown, irregularly shaped area with a central, darker, branching structure. It is surrounded by normal-appearing skin with a few hairs. The lesion appears to be benign, possibly a seborrheic keratosis or a similar benign lesion."
188,benign,"The lesion is a small, round, brown macule with a slightly irregular border. It has a central area of darker pigmentation and a lighter, almost translucent area in the center. The surrounding skin is pink and has some fine hairs.",Benign,"The lesion is a brown, relatively round, well-defined spot with a slightly irregular border. It appears to have a central darker area and a lighter halo around it. The overall appearance is consistent with a benign melanocytic nevus."
3050,malignant,"The lesion is a raised, dark, and crusted nodule with a central area of darker, possibly ulcerated, material. The surrounding skin shows signs of sun damage with freckles and age spots. There are also several other smaller, darker spots nearby.",Malignant,"The lesion appears to be a dark, crusted nodule with a surrounding area of erythema. It has a central, possibly ulcerated, area with some crusting. The surrounding skin shows evidence of sun damage with freckling and other small, darker spots. The lesion is not very well-defined and appears to be raised. It is difficult to say definitively if it is malignant or benign based on this image alone. However, given the dark color and crusted appearance, it could be a type of skin cancer such as a squamous cell carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma. Further evaluation is needed to determine the nature of this lesion."
416,malignant,"The lesion appears to be a raised, irregular growth with a central crusted area and surrounding erythema. There are also multiple small, dark, punctate structures surrounding the main lesion. The surrounding skin shows signs of sun damage with numerous small, brownish spots and some areas of redness.",Malignant,"The lesion appears to be a combination of several smaller lesions. There are areas of redness and scaling, some with crusting. There are also several small, dark, punctate lesions, some of which appear to be black. The overall appearance is consistent with a skin lesion that could be malignant, but could also be benign. Further evaluation is needed to determine the nature of the lesion."
3310,malignant,"There are multiple lesions present. One lesion has a dark, crusted center with a surrounding raised, erythematous border. Another lesion appears to have a similar appearance but with a smaller, darker center. There are also several other smaller, pink, and slightly raised lesions. The skin overall is dry and has a rough texture with visible hair follicles.",Malignant,"The image shows multiple skin lesions with varying appearances. Some appear as raised, reddish, and scaly patches with a central crust or erosion. One lesion has a dark, possibly crusted, center. There is also a linear scar-like lesion. The overall appearance suggests a benign process, possibly actinic keratosis or a similar skin condition. However, a definitive diagnosis requires further evaluation by a healthcare professional."
2450,malignant,"The image shows a close-up of a person's face, specifically the nose and cheek area. There is a raised, textured area on the skin near the nose. The area appears to be slightly lighter in color than the surrounding skin and has a rough, uneven surface. There are also some small, darker spots visible within the raised area. The overall appearance is consistent with a benign skin lesion.",Benign,"The lesion appears as a small, raised, flesh-colored papule with a smooth surface. It is located on the nose and appears to be a benign keratosis."
969,malignant,"The image shows a raised, circular lesion with a central, whitish, crusted area. The lesion has a pinkish, inflamed border. There are also some brown spots around the lesion and on the surrounding skin. The surrounding skin shows signs of age-related changes, such as freckling and hair growth.",Malignant,"The lesion appears as a raised, pinkish nodule with a central crusted or ulcerated area. The surrounding skin shows signs of sun damage with freckling and age spots. The nodule appears to be a well-defined, but irregular border. The central area is whitish and appears to be crusted. Based on the appearance, it is difficult to definitively say if it is malignant or benign, but it does show some characteristics that may be concerning."
3325,other,"There is a small, dark brown lesion with a slightly irregular border. There is also a small, red area within the lesion. There are also several other small, brown spots and a few small red dots scattered around the area.",Benign,"The lesion is a small, raised, reddish-brown nodule with a slightly irregular border. It appears to be a benign lesion, possibly a seborrheic keratosis or a cherry angioma. However, a definitive diagnosis would require a biopsy or further evaluation."
3205,other,"The image shows a skin lesion that is brown in color with a somewhat irregular border. It appears to be a raised, roundish lesion with a slightly darker center. There are also other smaller, darker spots and a few hairs visible in the image.",benign,"The lesion is a brown, round, and well-defined spot with a slightly irregular border. It appears to be a benign melanocytic nevus, commonly known as a mole."
3230,other,"The lesion is a small, round, brown spot with a relatively uniform color. It appears to be slightly raised and has a smooth, non-rough surface. It is located on skin that has a fine, wrinkled texture. There are a few other smaller, similar spots visible in the surrounding skin.",Benign,"The lesion is a small, dark brown, round, and well-defined spot. It appears to be a benign melanocytic nevus (mole)."
1637,other,"There are multiple small, raised, brownish lesions of varying sizes and shapes scattered across the skin. Some appear to be slightly darker and more raised than others. There is also a small, dark, almost black, lesion that is more distinct. The skin appears wrinkled and dry.",Malignant,"The image shows a raised, firm, and somewhat nodular lesion with a smooth, pearly surface. There is a dark, possibly pigmented area within the lesion. The surrounding skin shows numerous small, brown macules and papules. The lesion appears to be a benign growth, possibly a sebaceous hyperplasia or a benign keratosis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact nature of the lesion."
260,other,"There is a dark, almost black, round lesion on the skin. It appears to be a single, well-defined spot with a smooth surface. The surrounding skin is pale and hairy. There are also several other small, brown and red spots scattered around the area.",benign,"The lesion is a small, dark, almost black, round spot on the skin. It appears to be a raised, well-defined lesion with a smooth surface. Based on the image alone, it is difficult to determine if it is malignant or benign. It could be a benign melanocytic nevus or a melanoma, or another type of lesion. Further examination and possibly a biopsy would be needed to determine its nature."
